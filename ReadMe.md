## About my App
When I started thinking about a project for the WWDC Student Challenge, I decided that I wanted to create something that was personally meaningful to me. In this way, I combined my three passions - math, soccer, and teaching - and created the game "Footmath". The project's objective is to provide a fun experience for children, just like what happened to me when I was learning math, so they can learn how to do calculations in a more playful and enjoyable way. The game is a fun and simple way to practice math, using the context of soccer to make learning enjoyable and engaging.

##About Me
My name is Guilherme Ferreira and I'm 24 years old. I am a Brazilian chemical engineering student and currently a participant in the Apple Developer Academy program, with the goal of becoming a Mobile iOS developer.
Upon joining the Apple Developer Academy, I was encouraged by tutors and peers to participate in the Swift Student Challenge. Despite never having developed an app before, this competition motivated me to acquire the necessary knowledge to turn my ideas into reality and deepen my studies in Swift, SwiftUI, computer science, and design.
Since I was a child, I have had a passion for mathematics, which was stimulated by a competition promoted by a teacher. The competition consisted of answering mathematical questions chosen by another student and asking questions chosen by me. This experience led me to study and practice the subject diligently, as well as talk about math with family and friends, further piquing my interest in STEM areas and having a very significant impact on what I study today: engineering.

##Features and technologies I used
    - I used the Figma software to develop the design and prototype of the screens. With this tool, I was able to efficiently create the visual identity and story of the game.
    - For the implementation of the game, I opted for the use of the SwiftUI framework. This choice was due to the ease of developing user interface layouts and behaviors with simple and easy-to-understand code. Additionally, SwiftUI allowed for different ideas to be tested during prototyping.
    - The device chosen for the creation of the game was the iPad. This is due to the advantages it offers for children's games, such as portability, a large screen, and an intuitive interface. Portability is important since children are always on the move and need a device that they can take anywhere. The large screen is ideal for children's games, allowing them to clearly see what is happening on the screen without worrying about viewing it on small screens. Finally, the intuitive interface of the iPad is perfect for children who often have difficulty understanding the complexity of other devices.
    - To ensure that the application was accessible to all users, including those with special needs, I used the website "whocanuse." This tool allowed me to test the accessibility of my application for people with different disabilities and implement the necessary changes to make it more inclusive.
